**Project Background**

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.

Unicorn is a family business owned by 2 entrepreneurs highly invested in their business. They already had a small data analytics team but wanted to expand it significantly. They reached out to me as a candidate for DA position and provide the dataset used for this analysis from their sales data.

My task was to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.

Find attached below, the python notebook with the SQL queries used for exploring and analyzing the dataset. Notebook opens here on GitHub
